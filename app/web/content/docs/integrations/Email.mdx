---

Authverse streamlines the setup of email providers with a single command. It supports **Resend**, **Gmail**, and **AWS SES**.

Execute the following command to start the setup:

```package-install
npx authverse@latest email
```

You will be prompted to choose your preferred email provider.

## Supported Providers

### Resend

If you choose Resend, the CLI will install the necessary dependencies and configure the email template.

After the command completes, add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=
EMAIL_SENDER_NAME="Your Name"
EMAIL_SENDER_ADDRESS=
```

### Gmail

For Gmail, you will need to provide your SMTP credentials.

After the command completes, add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
GMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
GMAIL_PORT=465
GMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
GMAIL_MAIL=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_NAME="Your Name"
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

> [!NOTE]
> For `GMAIL_PASSWORD`, you should use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) if you have 2-Step Verification enabled.

### AWS SES

For AWS SES, ensure you have your SMTP credentials ready from the AWS Console.

After the command completes, add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
AWS_SES_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
AWS_SES_PORT=465
AWS_SES_SERVICE=ses
AWS_SES_USER=
AWS_SES_PASS=
AWS_SES_FROM=
```

> [!TIP]
> Make sure your AWS SES account is out of the sandbox environment if you intend to send emails to unverified addresses.
