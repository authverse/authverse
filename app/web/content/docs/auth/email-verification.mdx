description: How to set up email verification flow using Authverse.
---

Authverse allows you to easily add email verification to your authentication flow.

## Setup

Execute the following command:

```package-install
npx authverse@latest verify
```

This command automatically:

- **Checks** for existing email configuration (and helps you set it up if missing).
- **Updates** `auth.ts` to enable `requireEmailVerification`.
- **Configures** the email verification logic in `auth.ts`.
- **Creates** the `EmailVerification` email template.

## How it works

When enabled, users will receive a verification email upon sign up. You can customize the behavior using the options in `auth.ts`:

```ts
emailVerification: {
  sendVerificationEmail: async ({ user, url }) => {
    // ... sending logic
  },
  sendOnSignUp: true, // Send email when user signs up
  sendOnSignIn: true, // Send email when user signs in (if not verified)
},
```

## Email Provider

This feature relies on the generic email integration. If you haven't set up an email provider yet, the CLI will prompt you to do so. See [Email Integration](/docs/integrations/Email) for details.
