description: How to set up forgot password flow using Authverse.
---

Authverse streamlines the addition of a "Forgot Password" flow with a single command.

## Setup email

Authverse supports multiple email providers (Gmail, Resend, AWS SES).

If you haven't set up an email provider yet, the command below will prompt you to choose one.
See [Email Integration](/docs/integrations/Email) for more details.

Execute the following command:

```package-install
npx authverse@latest forget
```

This command automatically:

- **Checks** for existing email configuration (and helps you set it up if missing).
- **Injects** password reset logic.
- **Creates** the email handler.
- **Sets up** the API route.
- **Adds** required environment variables.
- **Configures** the email template.

## Environment Configuration

If you are setting up email for the first time during this process, the CLI will ask you to add specific environment variables for your chosen provider.
