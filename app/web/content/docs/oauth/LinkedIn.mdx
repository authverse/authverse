This page details how to add and configure LinkedIn OAuth for Authverse projects.

## Install the LinkedIn Provider

Execute the following command to add the LinkedIn provider to your project:

```package-install
npx authverse@latest oauth LinkedIn
```

## Configure LinkedIn Developer Portal

Navigate to the **LinkedIn Developers portal** (My Apps → [Your App] → Auth) and configure the **Authorized Redirect URLs**:

- **Local development**:
  - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/LinkedIn`
- **Production**:
  - `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/LinkedIn`

## Environment Setup

Add the following variables to your project's `.env` file:

```bash
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Replace the values with the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your LinkedIn App.

> [!TIP]
> Adjust this configuration to use your preferred method for securely storing secrets in CI/CD pipelines.

## Import and Use the LinkedIn Provider Component

Import the prebuilt provider component and integrate it into your UI:

```tsx
import LinkedInOAuthButton from "@/components/authverse/LinkedInOAuthButton";

<LinkedInOAuthButton />;
```

This component renders the LinkedIn sign-in option at its location.

## Notes & Troubleshooting

- **Products**: Ensure you have added the **Sign In with LinkedIn** product to your app.
- **Production Domain**: For production environments, replace `https://example.com` with your authenticated domain.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure the redirect URI case matches exactly (e.g., `LinkedIn` vs `linkedin`).
