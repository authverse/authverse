This page details how to add and configure Facebook OAuth for Authverse projects.

## Install the Facebook Provider

Execute the following command to add the Facebook provider to your project:

```package-install
npx authverse@latest oauth facebook
```

## Configure Facebook Developer Portal

To use Facebook sign in, you need a client ID and client Secret. You can get them from the Facebook Developer Portal. Select your app, navigate to App Settings > Basic, locate the following:

- **App ID**
- **App Secret**

Navigate to the **Facebook Developers Console** (My Apps → [Your App] → Use cases → Authentication) and configure the **Redirect URIs**:

- **Local development**:
  - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/facebook`
- **Production**:
  - `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/facebook`

## Environment Setup

Add the following variables to your project's `.env` file:

```bash
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Replace the values with the **App ID** and **App Secret** from your Facebook App settings.

> [!TIP]
> Adjust this configuration to use your preferred method for securely storing secrets in CI/CD pipelines.

## Import and Use the Facebook Provider Component

Import the prebuilt provider component and integrate it into your UI:

```tsx
import FacebookOAuthButton from "@/components/authverse/FacebookOAuthButton";

<FacebookOAuthButton />;
```

This component renders the Facebook sign-in option at its location.

## Notes & Troubleshooting

- **App Mode**: Ensure your Facebook App is in **Live** mode to allow external users to sign in.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have requested the necessary permissions (e.g., `email`, `public_profile`).
- **Production Domain**: For production environments, replace `https://example.com` with your authenticated domain.
