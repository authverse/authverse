description: How to install and initialize Authverse in your project.
---

Authverse makes it simple to generate a complete, production-ready authentication system
for your project with a single command.

This guide covers quick install, optional UI screens, environment variables, and common
post-install steps so you can get up and running fast.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn available in your terminal

---

## Quick install

Run the following in your project root:

```package-install
npx authverse@latest init
```

The init command scaffolds configuration, models, routes, UI components (optional), and
recommended environment variables.

### Optional: Auth UI Screens (ShadCN)

Authverse can optionally scaffold ShadCN-based auth screens:

- Login
- Signup
- Modern, responsive layout using ShadCN components

Choose the UI option during init or run a later generator provided in the project.

---

## After setup

Once Authverse is installed and files are generated, complete the following:

### 1. Update `DATABASE_URL`

Open your `.env` file and set your database connection string, for example:

```
DATABASE_URL=""
```

### 2. If using Prisma

Run the following to generate the Prisma client and apply migrations:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 3. If using Drizzle ORM

Run the following to generate Drizzle SQL migrations:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"Missing env"** — confirm `.env` contains required keys.
- **"DB connection failed"** — verify `DATABASE_URL` and ensure your database is running.
- If issues persist, consult the generated README or open an issue in the Authverse repository.

---

You're ready — Authverse has scaffolded:

- Config & environment templates
- Database models & migrations
- Routes & handlers
- Optional Auth UI components
- Recommended folder structure

Happy building!
