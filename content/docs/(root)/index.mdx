# Introduction

Authentication is one of the most repeated and time-consuming parts of building modern applications.  
Setting up database models, configuring Better Auth, wiring OAuth providers, and designing UI screens often takes hours — sometimes days.

**Authverse solves this entire problem with a single command.**

It is a modern CLI tool that generates a full authentication system instantly inside your project.  
From database setup (Prisma or Drizzle) to ready-made ShadCN UI screens, OAuth integrations, and secure Better Auth configuration — everything is created automatically.

It removes complexity so you can focus on what matters most: **building your product**.
