This page describes how to add and configure GitHub OAuth for Authverse projects.

## Install the GitHub provider

Run the installer to add the GitHub provider to your project:

```bash
npx authverse@latest add github
```

## Configure Authorized Redirect URIs

In GitHub (Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → Your App), set the Authorization callback URL for your OAuth App:

- Local development:
  - http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
- Production:
  - https://example.com/api/auth/callback/github

If you change your auth base path (the default is `/api/auth`), update these redirect URIs to match the new base path.

## .env setup

Add the following variables to your project's `.env` file:

```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Replace the values with the client ID and client secret from your GitHub OAuth App.

Adjust the snippet to use your preferred method of securely storing secrets for CI/deploy pipelines.

## Import and use the GitHub provider component

Import the prebuilt provider component and add it to your UI:

```jsx
import GithubProviders from "@/components/authverse/GithubProviders";

<GithubProviders />;
```

This renders the GitHub sign-in option where you include the component.

## Notes & troubleshooting

- Ensure your OAuth App is configured correctly in GitHub and that the callback URL is exact.
- For production, replace `https://example.com` with your real production domain.
- If you change the auth callback path or deploy behind proxies, confirm the redirect URI and host are correct in your GitHub OAuth App settings.
