description: How to install and initialize Authverse in your project.
---

Authverse makes it simple to generate a complete, production-ready authentication system
for your project with a single command.

This guide covers quick install, optional UI screens, environment variables, and common
post-install steps so you can get up and running fast.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn available in your terminal
- A project folder (e.g., a Next.js, Remix, or Express app)

---

## Quick install

Run the following in your project root:

```package-install
npx authverse@latest init
```

The init command scaffolds configuration, models, routes, UI components (optional), and
recommended environment variables.

---

## Initialize and configure

1. Run the init command above.
2. Confirm generated files and review the new .env.example.
3. Copy .env.example → .env and fill in secrets (database URL, JWT secret, provider keys).
4. Run database migrations if required (see the generated README in your project).

---

### Optional: Auth UI Screens (ShadCN)

Authverse can optionally scaffold ShadCN-based auth screens:

- Login
- Signup
- Modern, responsive layout using ShadCN components

Choose the UI option during init or run a later generator provided in the project.

---

## Environment variables (example)

- DATABASE_URL=
- BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
- BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

Always keep secrets out of source control.

---

## After setup

- Review generated routes and API handlers.
- Run your dev server and test signup/login flows.
- Add email/SMS provider credentials for verification if needed.
- Commit the scaffolded code and update CI environment variables.

---

## Troubleshooting

- "Missing env" — confirm .env contains required keys.
- "DB connection failed" — verify DATABASE_URL and database is running.

---

You're ready — Authverse has scaffolded:

- Config & environment templates
- Database models & migrations
- Routes & handlers
- Optional Auth UI components
- Recommended folder structure

Happy building!
