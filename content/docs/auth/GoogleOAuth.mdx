This page describes how to add and configure Google OAuth for Authverse projects.

## Install the Google provider

Run the installer to add the Google provider to your project:

```bash
npx authverse@latest add google
```

## Configure Authorized Redirect URIs

In Google Cloud Console (APIs & Services → Credentials), set the Authorized Redirect URIs for your OAuth 2.0 Client ID:

- Local development:
  - http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
- Production:
  - https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google

If you change your auth base path (the default is `/api/auth`), update these redirect URIs to match the new base path.

## .env setup

Add the following variables to your project's `.env` file:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Replace the values with the client ID and client secret from Google Cloud Console.

Adjust the snippet to use your preferred method of securely storing secrets for CI/deploy pipelines.

## Import and use the Google provider component

Import the prebuilt provider component and add it to your UI:

```tsx
import GoogleProviders from "@/components/authverse/GoogleProviders";

<GoogleProviders />;
```

This renders the Google sign-in option where you include the component.

## Notes & troubleshooting

- Ensure your OAuth consent screen is configured and published in Google Cloud Console.
- For production, replace `https://example.com` with your real production domain.
- If you change the auth callback path or deploy behind proxies, confirm the redirect URI and host are correct in Google Cloud Console.
