This page details how to add and configure Google OAuth for Authverse projects.

## Install the Google Provider

Execute the following command to add the Google provider to your project:

```package-install
npx authverse@latest add google
```

## Configure Authorized Redirect URIs

Navigate to the **Google Cloud Console** (APIs & Services → Credentials) and configure the **Authorized Redirect URIs** for your OAuth 2.0 Client ID:

- **Local development**:
  - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
- **Production**:
  - `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google`

> [!NOTE]
> If you modify your auth base path (default: `/api/auth`), ensure these redirect URIs are updated to match.

## Environment Setup

Add the following variables to your project's `.env` file:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Replace the values with the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** obtained from the Google Cloud Console.

> [!TIP]
> Adjust this configuration to use your preferred method for securely storing secrets in CI/CD pipelines.

## Import and Use the Google Provider Component

Import the prebuilt provider component and integrate it into your UI:

```tsx
import GoogleProviders from "@/components/authverse/GoogleProviders";

<GoogleProviders />;
```

This component renders the Google sign-in option at its location.

## Notes & Troubleshooting

- **Consent Screen**: Ensure your OAuth consent screen is fully configured and published in the Google Cloud Console.
- **Production Domain**: For production environments, replace `https://example.com` with your authenticated domain.
- **Proxies**: If changing the auth callback path or deploying behind proxies, verify that the redirect URI and host settings in Google Cloud Console match your deployment configuration.
